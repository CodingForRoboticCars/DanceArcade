# Dance Arcade - a TM4C123 80 Mhz Embedded System Video game

Here is a video game I developed for the TM4C123 80 Mhz microcontroller during the Summer of 2019. I had an absolute blast making it, though difficult, it taught me a lot
about leveraging hardware (like system timers) to make features a reality. It took the entire summer, working day and night (with time also spent on classes and other stuff),
debugging, and reaching out to some of my graduate student connections for help. 

This project uses SD card libraries that have been provided to me by Professor Valvano at the University of Texas at Austin. I used this SD card code to store my music for
the game there. Other than that, all hardware and software interfaces have been developed from the ground up. Music is stored in data arrays, read from the SD card, 
sampled at 44.1 kHz, and outputted through a resistor ladder I made, to a 3.5 mm jack.

If you would like to make this a playable game for yourself, please reach out to me via my linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/virajwadhwa/ and I can help you setup what
the hardware you need to play this game!
