# Dance Arcade - a TM4C123 80 Mhz Embedded System Video game

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZSp_Ykef24

Here is a video game I developed for the TM4C123 80 Mhz microcontroller during the Summer of 2019. I had an absolute blast making it, though difficult, it taught me a lot
about leveraging hardware (like system timers) to make features a reality. It took the entire summer, working day and night (with time also spent on classes and other stuff),
debugging, and reaching out to some of my graduate student connections for help. Most of the code can be found in main.cpp

This project uses SD card libraries that have been provided to me by Professor Valvano at the University of Texas at Austin. I used this SD card code to store my music for
the game there. Other than that, all hardware and software interfaces have been developed from the ground up. Music is stored in data arrays, read from the SD card, 
sampled at 44.1 kHz, and outputted through a resistor ladder I made, to a 3.5 mm jack.

All the sprites have been self created with paint, and all the graphical images I used in the game are all non-copyrighted!
I am making this game for educational/project purposes only, no selling or commercial listings allowed. 

If you would like to make this a playable game for yourself, please reach out to me via my linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/virajwadhwa/ and I can help you setup
the hardware you need to play this game!
